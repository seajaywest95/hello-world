# hello-world
My first repository.

Hey everyone! Chris here. Nice to meet you! Just a brief about me I am 20 years young. 
I have been learning with Android OS for roughly a year. It started out for me following
a root method. I followed the guide, used Odin and eventually figured it out. I have
since followed devolping as close as possible. I have an amazing ability to learn fast
and adapt my mind to any challenge. I hope my drive, mind, and passion for learning code
and devolpment will evolve and help people live life easier. 

Enough about me, just wanted to say hello! Thanks for viewing my page here.
